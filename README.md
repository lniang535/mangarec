# mangarec
Mangarec is a simple, beginner-friendly application designed to help users find new manga and store personal ratings and reviews. The app will be small-scale as of now, only incorporating the basic search features through the use of an external API (Jikan API). By integrating live data from the Jikan API, the app displays up-to-date manga information without needing to build a giant database. The app allows users to search for manga titles, receive details such as genre, synopsis, and chapter count, and receive personalized suggestions based on their interests.The suggestion system uses a combination of genre matching and stored user ratings to suggest new titles the user might enjoy. We hope to augment the app by creating an actual website that users can interact with rather than just a terminal and to incorporate the review feature.
